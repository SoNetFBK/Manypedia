What is Manypedia?

On Manypedia you can compare the same Wikipedia page as it appears on 2
different language Wikipedias, both translated in your language.
For example you can search for a page in the English Wikipedia and compare it
with the same page on the Chinese Wikipedia but translated into English.

But, just as an example, you can also search for a page in the Arabic Wikipedia
and compare it with the same page in Hebrew Wikipedia but translated into
Arabic. Or from Italian into French, or from Tagalog into Catalan, or from
Hindi into Irish, or from Turkish into Yiddish, or from Persian into Swahili
as well, you've got the idea ;)
